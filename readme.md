# Insurely frontend code case

We have put together a skeleton for a webapp that shows detailed info about an insurance, but it doesn't do that yet.
Your assignment is to implement the provided design for the insurance page. Do as much as you can in maximum 3-4 hours.

**Focus on the implementation of the design**. The actual functionality of the page is secondary.

All the necessary insurance data is provided. One object for home insurance.

Don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions!

Good luck

## Building and running
